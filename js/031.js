// Either I don't know Javascript, or there is no good way to determine if I can
// use console.log or print.  NodeJS defines print, but defines it to throw a
// deprecation error.  SpiderMonkey doesn't define console, and "console ===
// undefined" throws an error.  I tried "this.console", but Node doesn't define
// this.console; console is somewhere higher up, and "this" isn't the toplevel
// binding/global object/whatever.  So I eventually broke down and put it into
// two files, to avoid having to do an eval to see if an error was thrown.
// FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU---
