# How many different ways can Â£2 be made using any number of coins?

# Two solutions in here, neither especially clean, but both were fun to write.

# The first Ruby version memoizes, and goes to lengths to avoid having to say
# the coin sizes more than once.  It manages to be fairly speedy, beating a few
# of the other solutions in this repo, including one of the Pez solutions.
# Most of the time spent, incidentally, is in these Hash/Array manipulations at
# the beginning.

$memo = Hash[*coins.zip(Array.new(coins.size){{}}).inject([], &:+)]
$next = Hash[*coins[0..-2].zip(coins[1..-1]).inject([], &:+)]

# I thought it would be fun to do one like the Pez solution that generates the
# words.  This version generates the methods and memoizes, and is line-noisy in
# general.
