Sometimes I'll play with Project Euler as a way to learn languages, gauge
relative speed, or learn a thing about number theory.

Here are the solutions, there aren't that many, and they're not that
good.  Some of them benchmark themselves, and some would be happier if
you typed 'time' before them.  Most of them are documented.  All of them
run in reasonable amounts of time (under a few seconds on semi-modern
hardware, usually under a second) except my Pez solutions for #145 and
#204, both of which (shamefully) take several minutes, and a novelty
solution in bash which takes about three hours or so.  The files are all
named consistently: $language/$problem_number.$ext, (with exceptions for
languages which tie module names and filenames and don't allow module names to
start with numbers, like Erlang and Limbo).  Some problems I have solved by
hand; these solutions usually aren't present in the code.

Everything in this repo is released into the public domain.  It's almost
all straightforward application of basic principals, but if you somehow
find a use for any of it, I'd be interested in hearing.
