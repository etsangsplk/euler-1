Sometimes I'll play with Project Euler as a way to learn languages, gauge
relative speed, or learn a thing about number theory.

Here are the solutions, there aren't that many, and they're not that
good.  Some of them benchmark themselves, and some would be happier if
you typed 'time' before them.  All of them run in reasonable amounts of
time.

Everything in this repo can be considered public domain.
