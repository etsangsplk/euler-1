Sometimes I'll play with Project Euler as a way to learn languages, gauge
relative speed, or learn a thing about number theory.

Here are the solutions, there aren't that many, and they're not that
good.  Some of them benchmark themselves, and some would be happier if
you typed 'time' before them.  Most of them are documented.  All of them
run in reasonable amounts of time (under a few seconds on semi-modern
hardware, usually under a second) except my solution for #145.  The files are
all named consistently:  $language/$problem_number.$ext.  

Everything in this repo can be considered public domain.
